/// The `InventoryType` enum defines various categories of inventory that an item can be classified into.

/// # Variants
/// - `Available`: Represents the inventory that is currently available for sale or use.
/// - `Committed` - Represents inventory that has been committed for an order or use but not yet fulfilled.
/// - `Incoming` - Represents inventory that is expected to arrive in the future.
/// - `Reserved` - Represents inventory that has been reserved for future use.
/// - `SafetyStock` - Represents the inventory kept aside as safety stock for emergencies.
/// - `Damaged` - Represents inventory that has been damaged and is not available for sale.
